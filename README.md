# VSCode Extensions Exporter
This tool will allow you to manage your listed extensions. You can choose to install all of them or just a specific one. The purpose of this tool is to help you to transfer your extensions from another VSCode to a new one, without having to search and install all of them.

# Requirements
### VSCode Extensions List

You can do this easily by typing <code>code --list-extensions > extensions</code>

**BEFORE ANYTHING:** For now, this tool will only parse a file named <code>extensions</code>. You'll have to put it inside the project's repository folder. Neverthless, I'm already thinking on a way to predict which file is the extensions list. 

# How to use it

* Clone this repo
* Copy your <code>extensions</code> file into the project's repository folder (as I early mentioned)
* Execute it by typing <code>./vscode-exporter.sh</code>
* Let the magic happen :smile:
