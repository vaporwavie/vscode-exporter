# VSCode Extensions Exporter
Imagine that you're going to buy a new dev laptop, and you'll have to consequently re-download every single one of your extensions from VSCode. This tool will do this for you, by parsing your extensions list and installing all of them or, as you wish, just a specific one.

# Requirements
### VSCode Extensions List

You can do this easily by typing <code>code --list-extensions > YOUR-FILE-NAME</code>

# How to use it

* Clone this repo
* Execute it by typing <code>./vscode-exporter.sh PATH/TO/EXTENSION-FILE</code>
* Let the magic happen :smile:
